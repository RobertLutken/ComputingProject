//1. Hello world

When programming it is important that we have some way of outputting what the program is doing. 
Such as calculating results or simply saying hello. 

To get your computer to say hello, in the box below type the words print "Hello world"

The print keyword tells the computer that you want to display something to the screen and the "Hello world" is the sentence that should be displayed. 

After you have finished, press the right > arrow to run your first every program !
