//3. Variables 

In python, variables are used to store information. 
Python lets us declare variables without needing to tell it what variable type it is. 

For example :
a = 1
b = 2
print a + b

if we wanted a to be a decimal number we could quite easily say 
a = 3.147

or if we wanted b to be a string ( a word )
b = "Hello"
