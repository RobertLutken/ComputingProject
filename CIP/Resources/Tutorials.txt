Tutorials 
1. Hello world

When programming it is important that we have some way of outputting what the program is doing. 
Such as calculating results or simply saying hello. 

To get your computer to say hello, in the box below type the words print "Hello world"

The print keyword tells the computer that you want to display something to the screen and the "Hello world" is the sentence that should be displayed. 

After you have finished, press the right > arrow to run your first every program !

2. Comments 
When programming large or small projects it is important to comment your code. 
Commenting is important to show that you understand what the code dose. It helps you say what you want to do in plain English. 
Often other programmers will read your code as well so it will help others too!

When you write comments they are completely ignored by the python.

To write a comment simply start your sentence with a # symbol. 
For example :
print("THIS IS NOT A COMMENT!")
# "print this is a comment, and is ignored by python !!"

If you want to write more than one line you can use three ''' 
For example : 

''''
I am a multi-line 
comment
...
'''
print ("No longer in comments!")

Try out a single line comment and multi line.
You can copy the above examples if you want too.

3. Variables 

In python, variables are used to store information. 
Python lets us declare variables without needing to tell it what variable type it is. 

For example :
a = 1
b = 2
print a + b

if we wanted a to be a decimal number we could quite easily say 
a = 3.147

or if we wanted b to be a string ( a word )
b = "Hello"

4. Operators

Mathematical Operations
These are the arithmetic operations available to you in python

print "1 + 1" # Adds two numbers
print "1 - 1" # Subtracts two numbers
print "2 * 2" #	Multiplies two numbers
print "2 / 4" # Divides two numbers 
print "3 % 2" # Get's the remainder

Assignment Operators 
a = 1	# a is equal to 1
print a
a += 1	# add one to the current value of a so a is now 2
print a
<EOF>
