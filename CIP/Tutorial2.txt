//2. Comments 
When programming large or small projects it is important to comment your code. 
Commenting is important to show that you understand what the code dose. It helps you say what you want to do in plain English. 
Often other programmers will read your code as well so it will help others too!

When you write comments they are completely ignored by the python.

To write a comment simply start your sentence with a # symbol. 
For example :
print("THIS IS NOT A COMMENT!")
# "print this is a comment, and is ignored by python !!"

If you want to write more than one line you can use three ''' 
For example : 

''''
I am a multi-line 
comment
...
'''
print ("No longer in comments!")

Try out a single line comment and multi line.
You can copy the above examples if you want too.
